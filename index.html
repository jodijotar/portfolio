                        I enjoy understanding the underlying concepts that explain how the technologies we use today actually work. Therefore, my interest in cybersecurity is directly related to my curiosity. My goal is to specialize in technologies related to web application development, specifically backend components. I plan to focus my learning on Python development.

                <strong>HackerOne | Eero (Amazon)</strong><br>Identified and reported a potential SQL injection vulnerability. Conducted a thorough risk assessment and provided a
                detailed report. The report was classified as informative, and it was an important step on my journey being my first
                report, it fueled my enthusiasm and desire to learn.
                <br>

                <br><strong>HackerOne | Airbnb</strong><br> Reported Path Traversal Vulnerability: Identified and reported a path traversal vulnerability on Airbnb's platform.
                The endpoint analyzed displayed unusual behavior, with various patches and filtering mechanisms in place.
                • Criticality Assessment and Learning Experience: While the vulnerability did not allow for arbitrary path traversal,
                leading to an overestimation of its criticality, this experience was immensely valuable. It deepened my understanding of
                complex filtering mechanisms and improved my skills in accurately assessing vulnerabilities.
